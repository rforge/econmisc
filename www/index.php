<h1>econMisc &mdash; miscellaneous econometrics functions</h1>

<p>This package is intended to be a collection of econometrics-related
  functions.  It is intended <em>not to be well-targeted and
  stable</em> package.  Just a "parking lot" for various functions on
  their way to specialized or simply better-suited packages.  However,
  the package should be complete, working, and error-free.  Feel free
  to download and use it exactly as any other R package.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>As an empirical economists, we are occasionally writing functions
  which might be of interest for the wider R community.  However,
  often they do not form a well targeted complete "package".  Rather,
  they are more like miscellaneous or even arbitrary functions we find
  necessary to implement ourselves.  Hence the package.</p>

<p>Feel free to use these functions as you like and eventually include
  them into another packages.</p>

<h2>Current features</h2>
